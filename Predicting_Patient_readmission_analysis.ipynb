The aim is to help hospitals take proactive measures in patient care and reduce operational and financial burdens.\n"

    "Hospital readmissions within 30 days can result in increased costs and penalties. An AI model that can predict the risk of readmission enables clinicians to take preemptive actions and improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Objectives:\n",
    "- Build a predictive model for patient readmission within 30 days.\n",
    "- Assist hospital staff in identifying at-risk patients during discharge.\n",
    "- Support planning for post-discharge care and interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üë• Stakeholders:\n",
    "- **Primary:** Physicians, nurses, hospital administration, patients.\n",
    "- **Secondary:** Data science team, regulatory bodies, insurance providers.\n"

    "- **Impute Missing Values:** Mean/mode for numerical; 'Unknown' for categorical.\n",

    "  - Count of prior hospital visits.\n",
    "  - Flag for chronic conditions.\n",
    "  - NLP-based discharge summary sentiment.\n",
    "- **Encoding:** One-hot encode categorical variables.\n",
